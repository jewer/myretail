#myRetail Case Study

##Background
For this case study, I wanted to challenge myself to pick up something I'm vaguely familiar with (I've worked on Spray APIs before) and see if I could get something elegant (and working) up in a reasonable amount of time.

##Tech/Design choices
I *love* the Akka dsl for defining routes.  It's not overly complex but it's still very descriptive.  Plus, I haven't been able to do any scala for 6 months and I really wanted to jump back in :-).
